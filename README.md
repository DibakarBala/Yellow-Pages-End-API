# Yellow Pages API

This repository contains the code for completely scraping the yellow pages website to get the details of all the categories from all the cities in America and 
then turning all of the data into an api to be used later.

Test the API at: [API Testing](https://hrushis-yellow-pages-end-api.herokuapp.com/)
